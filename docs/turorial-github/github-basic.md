So How Do You Get Started With GitHub?
It’s easy to get things going with GitHub. For starters, click onto the GitHub site and create an account. Then, consider installing Git on your system, especially if you plan on using your local computer. Then, go to your terminal and make yourself known to Git by setting up your user name in every repository. Use this command:

git config --global user.name "<your_name_here>"

Make sure the “your name here” parameter is your own name. Pick any name you’d like.

Next, share your email address with Git. It should be the same address you entered when you joined GitHub.

git config --global user.email "<your_email@email.com>"

You’re now ready to use Git!
