# Github features
So now we know what Git and GitHub are. Time to gain a better understanding of the importance and relevance of what is GitHub by exploring its features.

## GitHubâ€™s Features
1. Easy Project Management
GitHub is a place where project managers and developers come together to coordinate, track, and update their work so that projects are transparent and stay on schedule.

2. Increased Safety With Packages
Packages can be published privately, within the team, or publicly to the open-source community. The packages can be used or reused by downloading them from GitHub.

3. Effective Team Management
GitHub helps all the team members stay on the same page and organized. Moderation tools like Issue and **Pull Request** Locking help the team to focus on the code.

4. Improved Code Writing
Pull requests help the organizations to review, develop, and propose new code. Team members can discuss any implementations and proposals through these before changing the source code.

5. Increased Code Safety
GitHub uses dedicated tools to identify and analyze vulnerabilities to the code that other tools tend to miss. Development teams everywhere work together to secure the software supply chain, from start to finish.

6. Easy Code Hosting
All the code and documentation are in one place. There are millions of repositories on GitHub, and each repository has its own tools to help you host and release code.
